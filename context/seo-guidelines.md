# SEO Guidelines for Coherent AI Content

This document outlines SEO best practices and requirements for all Coherent AI blog content to maximize organic search visibility and rankings among SMB decision-makers searching for AI strategy guidance.

---

## Content Length Requirements

### Target Word Counts

- **Standard Blog Post**: 2,500-3,500 words (target: 2,800-3,200)
- **Pillar Content / Frameworks**: 3,000-4,000 words
- **Industry-Specific Guides**: 2,500-3,000 words
- **Case Studies**: 2,000-2,500 words

**Why Longer**: Our B2B audience (business leaders, managing partners) researches thoroughly before making $8K-$18K decisions. Comprehensive content builds trust and demonstrates expertise.

### Quality Over Quantity

- Don't add fluff to hit word counts
- Every section must provide strategic value
- Better to have 2,500 valuable words than 3,500 padded words
- Cut anything that doesn't reinforce systems thinking or demonstrate platform engineering expertise

## Keyword Optimization

### Primary Keyword Strategy

Focus on **long-tail, intent-driven keywords** that signal high commercial intent:

**High-Priority Keyword Themes**:
1. AI strategy and planning (decision phase)
2. AI integration challenges (problem-aware)
3. AI ROI measurement (justification phase)
4. Industry-specific AI implementation (solution-aware)
5. AI tool consolidation (action phase)

### Keyword Density Guidelines

- **Primary Keyword**: 1-2% density
  - Example: In a 3,000-word article, use keyword 30-60 times
  - Natural integration—never force keywords
- **Secondary Keywords**: 0.5-1% density each
- **Proprietary Terms**: Use freely without density concern
  - AI Sprawl, Coherent AI Ecosystems, Systems-Level Thinking

### Critical Keyword Placement

Primary keyword MUST appear in:
- [ ] H1 headline (preferably near the beginning)
- [ ] First 100 words of article
- [ ] At least 2-3 H2 subheadings
- [ ] Last paragraph / conclusion
- [ ] Meta title (within first 60 characters)
- [ ] Meta description
- [ ] URL slug

### Keyword Integration Best Practices

**Natural language first**: Write for business leaders, optimize for search engines

**Use variations**:
- "AI strategy for SMBs" → "SMB AI strategy" → "business AI planning" → "AI strategy consulting"
- "AI integration" → "integrate AI tools" → "AI system integration" → "integration architecture"

**Question formats** (target featured snippets):
- "How to measure AI ROI" → "measuring AI return on investment"
- "What is AI sprawl" → "defining AI sprawl"

**Semantic keywords** (support topical authority):
- For "AI strategy": include "systems architecture," "platform engineering," "integration planning," "coherence"
- For "AI ROI": include "cost reduction," "efficiency gains," "strategic value," "measurable outcomes"

### Keyword Stuffing (Avoid)

❌ "AI strategy is important. AI strategy helps SMBs. Our AI strategy services provide AI strategy consulting for AI strategy needs."

✅ "Strategic AI adoption requires systems-level thinking—the same discipline used in platform engineering at AMD and Intel. We architect coherent ecosystems where every component works in harmony."

---

## Content Structure Requirements

### Heading Hierarchy

#### H1 (Title)
- **Only one H1 per article**
- Include primary keyword naturally
- 60 characters or less (for SERP display)
- Problem-focused or benefit-driven
- Pattern: "From [Problem] to [Solution]: A [Framework] Approach"

**Examples**:
- ✅ "From AI Sprawl to AI Strategy: A Systems Architecture Approach"
- ✅ "The ROI of Coherence: How to Measure AI Integration Value"
- ❌ "AI Tips for Better Business" (too vague, no systems focus)

#### H2 (Main Sections)
- **5-7 H2 sections** for standard articles
- At least **3 should include keyword variations**
- Advance the narrative logically
- Can be read as outline (readers should understand flow from H2s alone)

**Pattern for H2s**:
1. The Problem (with specific data)
2. Why This Happens (root causes)
3. The Framework/Approach
4. Case Study/Example
5. Implementation/How-To
6. Conclusion

#### H3 (Subsections)
- Nested under H2s (never skip from H2 to H4)
- Break complex concepts into stages/phases
- Include keywords where natural
- More specific than H2s

### Article Structure Template

```markdown
# [H1: Problem-to-Solution with Primary Keyword]

## Introduction (200-300 words)
- Hook: Specific problem with numbers ($150K spend, 8-12 hours waste)
- Impact: Cost/consequence of that problem
- Reframe: Position as systems/architecture challenge
- Promise: Framework or solution reader will learn
- **Keyword in first 100 words**

## [H2: The Hidden Costs of [Problem]]

### Stage 2: [Action with timeline]
### Stage 3: [Action with timeline]

## [H2: Case Study: From Chaos to Clarity]
### Initial State (with specific metrics)
### Assessment (problems identified)
### Implementation (phased approach)
### Results (concrete outcomes)

## Conclusion (200-300 words)
- Restate core message
- Key takeaways (3-5 bullet points)
- Call to action (Navigator assessment or Strategy Audit)
