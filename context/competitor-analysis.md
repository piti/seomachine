## Coherent AI's Unique Positioning

**What makes us different** (emphasize in all content):
- **AI Systems Architects** (not consultants)
- **Platform engineering background** (20+ years AMD/Intel)
- **Systems-level thinking** (architecture over tools)
- **Proprietary frameworks** (AI Sprawl, Coherence Framework)
- **SMB focus** ($5M-$50M revenue sweet spot)
- **Integration expertise** (not just strategy decks)

## Primary Competitors (Generic AI Consultancies)

### Category: Traditional AI Consulting Firms

**Examples**: Deloitte AI, Accenture AI, PwC AI Practice

**Their Positioning**:
- Large-scale enterprise AI transformation
- Strategy consulting with implementation support
- Industry-specific AI solutions
- Large teams, high fees ($50K-$500K+ engagements)

**Content Strategy**:
- Enterprise-focused case studies
- Industry trend reports
- Whitepapers and research
- Thought leadership from partners

**Our Differentiation**:
- **Target SMBs** (they target Fortune 1000)
- **Systems architecture approach** (they use management consulting frameworks)
- **Platform engineering credibility** (they have MBAs, we have AMD/Intel engineers)
- **Hands-on integration focus** (they create PowerPoints, we architect systems)

**Content Opportunities**:
- "Why SMBs need different AI strategy than enterprises"
- "Platform engineering vs. management consulting for AI"
- "The integration gap large consultancies miss"

### Category: AI Tool Vendors (Posing as Strategic Advisors)

**Examples**: HubSpot AI consultants, Salesforce AI advisors

**Their Positioning**:
- Implementation partners for specific AI tools
- "Strategic guidance" that leads to their product
- Tool-first, integration-second approach

**Our Differentiation**:
- **Tool-agnostic** (we recommend what fits, not what we sell)
- **Integration-first** (architecture before tool selection)
- **No vendor lock-in** (neutral systems thinking)

**Content Opportunities**:
- "The hidden cost of vendor-led AI strategy"
- "Tool selection vs. systems architecture"
- "How to evaluate AI consultants: questions to ask"

## Content Gaps (Opportunities to Own)

**Topics competitors don't cover well**:
1. **AI Sprawl** (our proprietary term - own it)
2. **Systems architecture for business AI** (technical depth most lack)
3. **Integration architecture frameworks** (they talk strategy, not implementation)
4. **SMB-specific AI ROI models** (they focus on enterprise)
5. **Platform engineering for business leaders** (translate technical to strategic)

---

## Differentiation Messaging

**When mentioning competitors** (never name them directly):
- "Unlike typical AI consultancies..."
- "Traditional consulting firms focus on strategy decks..."
- "Tool vendors position themselves as strategic advisors..."
- "Most AI consultants learned AI last year..."

**Emphasize our unique value**:
- "20+ years building mission-critical platform architecture"
- "Systems architects, not management consultants"
- "Integration expertise from AMD/Intel"
- "We don't just recommend tools—we architect coherent ecosystems"

---

## Keyword Differentiation

**Avoid direct competition** on these terms (they own them):
- "AI consulting services"
- "AI transformation consulting"
- "Enterprise AI strategy"

**Dominate these unique terms**:
- "AI systems architect" / "AI systems architecture"
- "AI sprawl"
- "AI integration architecture"
- "Platform engineering for AI"
- "Coherent AI ecosystems"

**Update quarterly with new competitor observations and messaging refinements.**
