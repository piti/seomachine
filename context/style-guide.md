## Grammar & Mechanics

### Capitalization

**Headlines & Subheadings**:
- **Decision**: Sentence case (Only capitalize first word and proper nouns)
- Exception: Proprietary terms always capitalized (AI Sprawl, Coherent AI Ecosystems)

**Product/Company Names**:
- Coherent AI: Always capital C and A
- AI Opportunity Navigator: Capital A, I, O, N
- SEOMachine: Capital S, E, O, M (proper noun, one word)

**Industry Terms**:
- AI: Always caps
- SMB / SMBs: Small-to-mid-sized businesses (always caps)
- CRM, ERP, API: Always caps (standard acronyms)
- Make.com, ChatGPT: Preserve vendor capitalization
- Platform engineering, systems architecture: Lowercase (common terms)

### Numbers

**When to Spell Out**:
- Spell out: One through nine (except for data/stats)
- Use numerals: 10 and above
- **Exceptions** (always use numerals):
  - Percentages: 5%, 40%, 150%
  - Money: $5, $500, $150,000
  - Measurements: 5 GB, 20 hours, 12 weeks
  - Lists/stats: Always use numerals for scannability
  - Time savings: 8-12 hours, 6-8 weeks

**Large Numbers**:
- Use commas: 1,000; 10,000; 150,000
- Spell out large: $2 million, $150K (when K is used, always in context with $)
- Consistency: Choose $150,000 or $150K per article, don't mix

**Ranges**:
- Use en dash with no spaces: 8-12 hours, $5M-$50M, 20-30%

### Punctuation

**Oxford Comma**:
- **YES** - Always use Oxford comma (A, B, and C)
- Example: "Integration, architecture, and coherence are key principles."

**Em Dashes**:
- Style: — (em dash, no spaces on either side)
- Usage: For parenthetical statements, emphasis, or interrupting thought
- Example: "AI Sprawl—a chaotic accumulation of disconnected tools—creates more friction than value."

**Quotation Marks**:
- Use "curly quotes" (not "straight quotes")
- Punctuation inside quotes: "AI Sprawl," not "AI Sprawl",

**Ellipses**:
- Three dots: ...
- No spaces before or after
- Use sparingly: Only for omitted text in quotes

### Abbreviations & Acronyms

**First Use**:
- Spell out on first use, acronym in parentheses
- Example: "Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems..."
- Exceptions for universally known: AI, SEO, ROI, CTA, API

**Common Business/Tech Acronyms**:
- CRM: Customer Relationship Management
- ERP: Enterprise Resource Planning
- ROI: Return on Investment
- SMB: Small-to-mid-sized business
- API: Application Programming Interface
- LLM: Large Language Model

**Latin Abbreviations**:
- **Avoid**: e.g., i.e., etc.
- **Use instead**: "for example," "that is," "and others"
- **Reason**: More accessible to global audience

## Word Choice & Usage

### Preferred Terms

**Say This** → **Not That**:
- **AI Systems Architects** → AI Consultants (We're not consultants)
- **AI Sprawl** → Tool chaos / fragmentation (Our proprietary term)
- **Coherent AI Ecosystems** → Integrated AI systems (More specific to our brand)
- **Strategic Advisory** → Consulting services (Elevates positioning)
- **Platform Engineering** → Technical background (More specific)
- **Systems-Level Thinking** → Holistic approach (More technical)
- **Integration Architecture** → Connecting tools (More professional)
- **Tech Stack** → Software / tools (Industry standard)
- **SMBs** → Small businesses (More precise B2B)
- **Business Operations** → Workflows / processes (More strategic)

### Words to Avoid (Buzzwords)

Never use these without specific context:
- "Revolutionary" (unless citing specific revolution)
- "Game-changing" (overused, vague)
- "Disruptive" / "Disruption" (cliché)
- "Cutting-edge" (implies recency over substance)
- "Leverage" as verb (use "use" or "apply")
- "Synergy" (corporate speak)
- "Best-in-class" (empty superlative)
- "Innovative" (show innovation, don't claim it)
- "Transform" / "Transformational" (overused; use sparingly with specifics)
- "Passionate" (emotional, not technical)
- "Empower" (overused)

### Words to Use Sparingly

Reduce or eliminate:
- "Very," "really," "actually," "just," "simply"
- "Things" (be specific: "tools," "systems," "components")
- "Nice," "great," "awesome" (use concrete descriptors)

### Inclusive Language

- Use gender-neutral language: "they" instead of "he/she"
- "Business leaders" or "decision-makers" (not gendered terms)
- Avoid idioms that may not translate globally ("hit it out of the park")
- Be mindful of accessibility in descriptions

---

## Formatting Standards

- Examples: **AI Sprawl**, **integration architecture**, **systems-level thinking**
- Don't overuse: 2-4 bold phrases per 500 words maximum

**Italics**:
- Use for: Emphasis (sparingly), contrast, thought emphasis
- Example: "This isn't a software problem. It's a *systems architecture* problem."
- Avoid for: Entire sentences or long phrases

**Underline**:
- Do not use (reserve for links only)

**ALL CAPS**:
- Only for standard acronyms: AI, ROI, CRM, ERP, API, SMB

- Format: 1. 2. 3. (with period after number)
- Same capitalization and punctuation rules as bullets

**Nested Lists**:
- Maximum 2 levels deep for readability
- Use consistent indentation

### Links

**Anchor Text**:
- Descriptive (tell reader where they're going)

---

## Content Structure

### Article Introduction

**Standard Structure** (200-300 words):
1. **Hook** (2-3 sentences): Specific problem with numbers/data
2. **Impact** (2-3 sentences): Cost/consequence of that problem
3. **Reframe** (2-3 sentences): Position as systems/architecture challenge
4. **Promise** (1-2 sentences): What reader will learn

**Keyword Placement**:
- Primary keyword in first 100 words
- Natural integration (not forced)
- Example: "AI sprawl" appears naturally in problem statement

**Example Opening**:
"The average SMB now spends $150,000 annually on AI-powered tools [hook with data]. These tools don't communicate with each other, forcing teams to manually transfer data between systems [impact]. This isn't a software problem—it's a systems architecture problem [reframe]. This article presents a framework for transforming AI Sprawl into coherent AI strategy [promise]."

### Section Length

- **Minimum**: 200 words per main section
- **Maximum**: 500 words per main section (break into subsections if longer)
- **Ideal**: 300-400 words per main section
- **Subsections**: 150-300 words each

### Heading Hierarchy

- **H1**: Article title only (one per article)
- **H2**: Major sections (The Problem, The Framework, Case Study, Conclusion)
- **H3**: Subsections within H2s (Stage 1, Stage 2, Implementation Phase)
- **Never skip levels**: H1 → H2 → H3 (not H1 → H3)

### Conclusion

**Standard Structure** (200-300 words):
1. **Restate core message** (2-3 sentences): Main argument distilled
2. **Key takeaways** (3-5 bullet points or short paragraphs)
3. **Call to action** (2-3 sentences): What reader should do next
4. **Confident close** (1 sentence): Forward-looking, systems-focused

**Example Conclusion Pattern**:
"AI Sprawl is not inevitable [restate]. It's the predictable outcome of tool-centric thinking [core argument]. Organizations that embrace systems architecture achieve 5-10x higher ROI [takeaway]. The journey requires upfront investment in strategy and integration, but the payoff is substantial [honest about effort]. [Link to Navigator or Strategy Audit] [CTA]."
